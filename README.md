Rules: 
Hello, welcome to Riddle Me This! 
For your challenge you will have to answer 5 random riddles!
After three wrong guesses you will be given the option for a hint, 
and will get the option with each subsequent guess.
All answers are one word and guesses with spaces will not be accepted. 
If you are confident in your guess but it says that it's wrong, try again 
with or without an S (ex. boat and boats).
